Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me.<br /> <br />Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges - how to get relative with the inevitable - you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.”<br /> <br />So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops.<br /> <br />Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears.<br /> <br />It’s a love letter. To life.<br /> <br />It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights - and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too.<br /> <br />Good luck.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />RUNNING TIME =&gt; 6:46:31"",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""3636965"",""name"":""Matthew McConaughey"",""role"":""Narrator"",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1598977375p5/3636965.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1598977375p2/3636965.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3636965.Matthew_McConaughey"",""average_rating"":""4.29"",""ratings_count"":""17707"",""text_reviews_count"":""2854""}},""published"":""2020"",""work"":{""id"":""78998213"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.8IRzJ--Wk32Lk5GO""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""3327491563"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,Wed Dec 16 10:21:36 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 16 10:20:31 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 16 10:21:36 -0800 2020,2,"

It's not what you think. <br /><b>\n  <br />\n</b>Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.<br /><br />David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.<br /><br />Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, <i>Range</i> makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""6584639"",""name"":""David Epstein"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6584639.David_Epstein"",""average_rating"":""4.14"",""ratings_count"":""698"",""text_reviews_count"":""103""}},""published"":""2019"",""work"":{""id"":""65183769"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.dmpkPJ7cHWotWEf7VKgqyg""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""3317718055"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,Thu Dec 10 13:54:41 -0800 2020,Thu Dec 10 13:54:29 -0800 2020,Thu Dec 10 13:54:41 -0800 2020,2,"

It has led nothing short of a revolution in the entertainment industries, generating billions of dollars in annual revenue while capturing the imaginations of hundreds of millions of people in over 190 countries. But to reach these great heights, Netflix, which launched in 1998 as an online DVD rental service, has had to reinvent itself over and over again. This type of unprecedented flexibility would have been impossible without the counterintuitive and radical management principles that cofounder Reed Hastings established from the very beginning. Hastings rejected the conventional wisdom under which other companies operate and defied tradition to instead build a culture focused on freedom and responsibility, one that has allowed Netflix to adapt and innovate as the needs of its members and the world have simultaneously transformed.<br /><br />Hastings set new standards, valuing people over process, emphasizing innovation over efficiency, and giving employees context, not controls. At Netflix, there are no vacation or expense policies. At Netflix, adequate performance gets a generous severance, and hard work is irrel-evant. At Netflix, you don't try to please your boss, you give candid feedback instead. At Netflix, employees don't need approval, and the company pays top of market. When Hastings and his team first devised these unorthodox principles, the implications were unknown and untested. But in just a short period, their methods led to unparalleled speed and boldness, as Netflix quickly became one of the most loved brands in the world.<br /><br />Here for the first time, Hastings and Erin Meyer, bestselling author of <i>The Culture Map </i>and one of the world's most influential business thinkers, dive deep into the controversial ideologies at the heart of the Netflix psyche, which have generated results that are the envy of the business world. Drawing on hundreds of interviews with current and past Netflix employees from around the globe and never-before-told stories of trial and error from Hastings's own career, <i>No Rules Rules </i>is the fascinating and untold account of the philosophy behind one of the world's most innovative, imaginative, and successful companies."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""19792006"",""name"":""Reed Hastings"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19792006.Reed_Hastings"",""average_rating"":""4.32"",""ratings_count"":""2919"",""text_reviews_count"":""351""}},""published"":""2020"",""work"":{""id"":""74541588"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.UQYj_KeYPB5Vlu3p""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""3273135881"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Thu Nov 12 15:32:11 -0800 2020,Thu Nov 12 15:32:17 -0800 2020,1,"

After all, a substantial number of decisions that we make in our everyday lives are quietly rooted in this one question: If something happened before, will it happen again? Is there such a thing as being in the zone? Can someone have a “hot hand”? Or is it simply a case of seeing patterns in randomness? Or, if streaks are possible, where can they be found?<br /><br />In The Hot Hand, Wall Street Journal reporter Ben Cohen offers an unfailingly entertaining and provocative investigation into these questions. He begins with how a $35,000 fine and a wild night in New York revived a debate about the existence of streaks that was several generations in the making. We learn how the ability to recognize and then bet against streaks turned a business school dropout named David Booth into a billionaire, and how the subconscious nature of streak-related bias can make the difference between life and death for asylum seekers. We see how previously unrecognized streaks hidden amidst archival data helped solve one of the most haunting mysteries of the twentieth century, the disappearance of Raoul Wallenberg. Cohen also exposes how streak-related incentives can be manipulated, from the five-syllable word that helped break arcade profit records to an arc of black paint that allowed Stephen Curry to transform from future junior high coach into the greatest three-point shooter in NBA history. Crucially, Cohen also explores why false recognition of nonexistent streaks can have cataclysmic results, particularly if you are a sugar beet farmer or the sort of gambler who likes to switch to black on the ninth spin of the roulette wheel.<br /><br />A brilliant investigation into when streaks exist and how they can be taken advantage of, The Hot Hand is essential reading for anyone who thinks they’ve got a shot."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""20115239"",""name"":""Ben  Cohen"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_200x266-d279b33f8eec0f27b7272477f09806be.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/m_50x66-82093808bca726cb3249a493fbd3bd0f.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/20115239.Ben_Cohen"",""average_rating"":""3.79"",""ratings_count"":""416"",""text_reviews_count"":""57""}},""published"":""2020"",""work"":{""id"":""65707658"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.mup9srKcduREGAG4fsT93A""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""3228000929"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Oct 13 20:37:48 -0700 2020,Tue Oct 13 20:37:55 -0700 2020,1,"

In barely six years, a small group of young, ambitious programmers in Silicon Valley built an $11.5 billion business out of the ashes of a failed podcasting company. Today Twitter boasts more than 200 million active users and has affected business, politics, media, and other fields in innumerable ways.<br /> <br />Now Nick Bilton of the New York Times takes readers behind the scenes with a narrative that shows what happened inside Twitter as it grew at exponential speeds. This is a tale of betrayed friendships and high-stakes power struggles as the four founders—Biz Stone, Evan Williams, Jack Dorsey, and Noah Glass—went from everyday engineers to wealthy celebrities, featured on magazine covers, Oprah, The Daily Show, and Time’s list of the world’s most influential people.<br /> <br />Bilton’s exclusive access and exhaustive investigative reporting—drawing on hundreds of sources, documents, and internal e-mails—have enabled him to write an intimate portrait of fame, influence, and power.

Do you want help figuring out who you are and why you're stuck in the same ruts? The Enneagram is an ancient personality type system with an uncanny accuracy in describing how human beings are wired, both positively and negatively. In <i>The Road Back to You</i> Ian Morgan Cron and Suzanne Stabile forge a unique approach―a practical, comprehensive way of accessing Enneagram wisdom and exploring its connections with Christian spirituality for a deeper knowledge of God and of ourselves. Funny and filled with stories, this book allows you to understand more about each of the Enneagram types, keeping you turning the pages long after you have read the chapter about yourself. Beginning with changes you can start making today, the wisdom of the Enneagram can help you get on the road that will take you further along into who you really are―leading you into places of spiritual discovery you would never have found on your own, and paving the way to the wiser, more compassionate person you want to become."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""469393"",""name"":""Ian Morgan Cron"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1571173753p5/469393.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1571173753p2/469393.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/469393.Ian_Morgan_Cron"",""average_rating"":""4.23"",""ratings_count"":""36182"",""text_reviews_count"":""3424""}},""published"":""2016"",""work"":{""id"":""48314516"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.NJDUQ4EYqI4Rlju8Fvau2w""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""3016626319"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Sat Jun 06 05:14:20 -0700 2020,Wed Oct 14 18:53:45 -0700 2020,1,"

While this advice may work for everyday life, it is, as Kim Scott has seen, a disaster when adopted by managers. Scott earned her stripes as a highly successful manager at Google and then decamped to Apple, where she developed a class on optimal management. She has earned growing fame in recent years with her vital new approach to effective management, the radical candor method. Radical candor is the sweet spot between managers who are obnoxiously aggressive on one side and ruinously empathetic on the other. Its about providing guidance, which involves a mix of praise as well as criticismdelivered to produce better results and help employees achieve.Great bosses have strong relationships with their employees, and Scott has identified three simple principles for building better relationships with your employees: make it personal, get (sh)it done, and understand why it matters.Radical Candor offers a guide to those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who manage bosses.

James Clear distils the most fundamental information about habit formation, so you can accomplish more by focusing on less.' Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck<br />________________________________<br /><br />A revolutionary system to get 1 per cent better every day<br /><br />People think when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions – doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.<br /><br />He calls them atomic habits.<br /><br />In this ground-breaking book, Clear reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.<br /><br />These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.<br />________________________________<br /><br />'James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits.

Morale had deteriorated, competition was more intense, and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company's history. \""I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past,\"" Iger writes. \""The only thing that mattered was the future, and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go.\"" It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.<br /><br />Twelve years later, Disney is the largest, most respected media company in the world counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time.<br /><br />Now, he's sharing the lessons he's learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It's also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving <i>Star Wars</i> myth.<br /><br />\""Over the past fourteen years, I think I've learned so much about what real leadership is,\"" Iger writes. \""But I couldn't have articulated all of this until I lived it.

Can our world support that? What kind of world will it be? Those answering these questions generally fall into two deeply divided groups--Wizards and Prophets, as Charles Mann calls them in this balanced, authoritative, nonpolemical new book. The Prophets, he explains, follow William Vogt, a founding environmentalist who believed that in using more than our planet has to give, our prosperity will lead us to ruin. <i>Cut back</i>! was his mantra. <i>Otherwise everyone will lose</i>! The Wizards are the heirs of Norman Borlaug, whose research, in effect, wrangled the world in service to our species to produce modern high-yield crops that then saved millions from starvation. <i>Innovate</i>! was Borlaug's cry. <i>Only in that way can everyone win</i>! Mann delves into these diverging viewpoints to assess the four great challenges humanity faces--food, water, energy, climate change--grounding each in historical context and weighing the options for the future.

He also emphasizes fundamental techniques for handling people without making them feel manipulated. Carnegie says you can make someone want to do what you want them to by seeing the situation from the other person's point of view and \""arousing in the other person an eager want.\"" You learn how to make people like you, win people over to your way of thinking, and change people without causing offense or arousing resentment.

Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It’s the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.<br /><br />In this timely and enlightening book, the bestselling author of Deep Work introduces a philosophy for technology use that has already improved countless lives.<br /><br />Digital minimalists are all around us. They’re the calm, happy people who can hold long conversations without furtive glances at their phones. They can get lost in a good book, a woodworking project, or a leisurely morning run. They can have fun with friends and family without the obsessive urge to document the experience. They stay informed about the news of the day, but don’t feel overwhelmed by it. They don’t experience “fear of missing out” because they already know which activities provide them meaning and satisfaction.<br /><br />Now, Newport gives us a name for this quiet movement, and makes a persuasive case for its urgency in our tech-saturated world. Common sense tips, like turning off notifications, or occasional rituals like observing a digital sabbath, don’t go far enough in helping us take back control of our technological lives, and attempts to unplug completely are complicated by the demands of family, friends and work. What we need instead is a thoughtful method to decide what tools to use, for what purposes, and under what conditions.<br /><br />Drawing on a diverse array of real-life examples, from Amish farmers to harried parents to Silicon Valley programmers, Newport identifies the common practices of digital minimalists and the ideas that underpin them. He shows how digital minimalists are rethinking their relationship to social media, rediscovering the pleasures of the offline world, and reconnecting with their inner selves through regular periods of solitude. He then shares strategies for integrating these practices into your life, starting with a thirty-day “digital declutter” process that has already helped thousands feel less overwhelmed and more in control.<br /><br />Technology is intrinsically neither good nor bad. The key is using it to support your goals and values, rather than letting it use you.

And thirty years later, if you're going to read only one book on Watergate, that's still the one. Today, Enron is the biggest business story of our time, and <b>Fortune</b> senior writers Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind are the new Woodward and Bernstein.<br /><br />Remarkably, it was just two years ago that Enron was thought to epitomize a great New Economy company, with its skyrocketing profits and share price. But that was before <b>Fortune</b> published an article by McLean that asked a seemingly innocent question: How exactly does Enron make money? From that point on, Enron's house of cards began to crumble. Now, McLean and Elkind have investigated much deeper, to offer the definitive book about the Enron scandal and the fascinating people behind it.<br /><br />Meticulously researched and character driven, <b>Smartest Guys in the Room</b> takes the reader deep into Enron's past—and behind the closed doors of private meetings. Drawing on a wide range of unique sources, the book follows Enron's rise from obscurity to the top of the business world to its disastrous demise. It reveals as never before major characters such as Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Andy Fastow, as well as lesser known players like Cliff Baxter and Rebecca Mark. <b>Smartest Guys in the Room</b> is a story of greed, arrogance, and deceit—a microcosm of all that is wrong with American business today. Above all, it's a fascinating human drama that will prove to be the authoritative account of the Enron scandal."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""65798"",""name"":""Bethany McLean"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1450195935p5/65798.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1450195935p2/65798.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65798.Bethany_McLean"",""average_rating"":""4.14"",""ratings_count"":""25164"",""text_reviews_count"":""1264""}},""published"":""2004"",""work"":{""id"":""1604"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.RyJKjWCEordvIyt7SuATfQ""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""2740372079"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Fri Dec 20 13:05:39 -0800 2019,Fri Dec 20 13:05:40 -0800 2019,1,"

And what about individual potential: what defines a person’s limits?<br /><br />For years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation. <i>Endure</i> widely disseminates these findings for the first time: It’s the brain that dictates how far we can go—which means we can always push ourselves further.<br /><br />Hutchinson presents an overview of science’s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs’ legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits (like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, we go until the tank runs out of gas), he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals—whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid—and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.<br /><br />An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology—brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging—and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today and shows how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance—and get the most out of their bodies."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""5038088"",""name"":""Alex  Hutchinson"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1518724873p5/5038088.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1518724873p2/5038088.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5038088.Alex_Hutchinson"",""average_rating"":""4.12"",""ratings_count"":""8987"",""text_reviews_count"":""868""}},""published"":""2018"",""work"":{""id"":""56364072"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.PjLYDTbZOLz1Dj1ZyF8KAQ""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2696574036"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Thu Nov 14 14:39:26 -0800 2019,Thu Nov 14 14:40:24 -0800 2019,1,"
