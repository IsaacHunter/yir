Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved <i>Seinfeld </i>from the cutting-room floor.

We are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. It is a muscle that everyone can build. <br /><i> Option B </i>combines Sheryl's personal insights with Adam's eye-opening research on finding strength in the face of adversity. Beginning with the gut-wrenching moment when she finds her husband, Dave Goldberg, collapsed on a gym floor, Sheryl opens up her heart--and her journal--to describe the acute grief and isolation she felt in the wake of his death. But <i>Option B </i>goes beyond Sheryl's loss to explore how a broad range of people have overcome hardships including illness, job loss, sexual assault, natural disasters, and the violence of war. Their stories reveal the capacity of the human spirit to persevere . . . and to rediscover joy.<br /> Resilience comes from deep within us and from support outside us. Even after the most devastating events, it is possible to grow by finding deeper meaning and gaining greater appreciation in our lives. <i>Option B </i>illuminates how to help others in crisis, develop compassion for ourselves, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces. Many of these lessons can be applied to everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead. Two weeks after losing her husband, Sheryl was preparing for a father-child activity. \""I want Dave,\"" she cried. Her friend replied, \""Option A is not available,\"" and then promised to help her make the most of Option B.<br /> We all live some form of Option B.

Balancing between soulful spirituality and cheerful pragmatism, Gilbert encourages us to uncover the “strange jewels” that are hidden within each of us.

The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.<br /><br />Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.<br /><br />An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.<br /><br />What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. <br /><br />They succeeded by transforming habits.<br /><br />In <i>The Power of Habit, </i>award-winning <i>New York Times</i> business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. <br /><br />Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<br /><br />At its core, <i>The Power of Habit</i> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. <br /><br />Habits aren’t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""5201530"",""name"":""Charles Duhigg"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349273209p5/5201530.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1349273209p2/5201530.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5201530.Charles_Duhigg"",""average_rating"":""4.09"",""ratings_count"":""379378"",""text_reviews_count"":""19534""}},""published"":""2012"",""work"":{""id"":""17624817"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.gRJ7ixmb9Hyc0lfIw7m6og""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018201503"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:24:40 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:24:40 -0700 2018,0,"

But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.<br /><br />Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?<br /><br />David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly American story of Wilbur and Orville Wright.<br /><br />Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing. The house they lived in had no electricity or indoor plumbing, but there were books aplenty, supplied mainly by their preacher father, and they never stopped reading.<br /><br />When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education, little money and no contacts in high places, never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off in one of their contrivances, they risked being killed.<br /><br />In this thrilling book, master historian David McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers' story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""6281688"",""name"":""David McCullough"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1429921568p5/6281688.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1429921568p2/6281688.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6281688.David_McCullough"",""average_rating"":""4.07"",""ratings_count"":""789258"",""text_reviews_count"":""34879""}},""published"":""2015"",""work"":{""id"":""42099162"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.zhVWOWoXznxTGTKwpQ835Q""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2253823868"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Wed Nov 28 10:32:02 -0800 2018,Wed Nov 28 10:32:03 -0800 2018,0,"

In <i>Own The Moment</i>, he shares the unlikely and inspiring story of how he went from being an average teenager who couldn’t care less about church to leading one of the country’s fastest-growing congregations—how one day he is trying to convince a Virginia Beach 7-Eleven clerk to attend his service, and just a few years later he is baptizing a global music icon in an NBA player’s Manhattan bathtub.<br /> <br /> Amid such candid personal tales, Lentz also offers illuminating readings of Bible passages and practical tips on how to live as a person of faith in an increasingly materialistic world. How do you maintain your values—and pass them onto your children—in a society that worships money and sex and fame? How do you embrace your flaws in this Instagram era that exalts the appearance of perfection? How do you forget about “living the dream” and learn to embrace the beauty of your reality?<br /> <br /> These are just a few of the many important questions Lentz answers in <i>Own The Moment</i>—a powerful book that redefines not just Christianity but spirituality as a whole."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""14246332"",""name"":""Carl Lentz"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506464301p5/14246332.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1506464301p2/14246332.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14246332.Carl_Lentz"",""average_rating"":""4.30"",""ratings_count"":""1235"",""text_reviews_count"":""122""}},""published"":""2017"",""work"":{""id"":""56090742"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.3oz2fY6CLf6jBUYIwRnYVQ""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""2194801532"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Wed Oct 03 07:02:58 -0700 2018,Wed Oct 03 07:03:08 -0700 2018,1,"

Then came SuperFreakonomics, a documentary film, an award-winning podcast, and more.<br /><br />Now, with Think Like a Freak, Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner have written their most revolutionary book yet. With their trademark blend of captivating storytelling and unconventional analysis, they take us inside their thought process and teach us all to think a bit more productively, more creatively, more rationally—to think, that is, like a Freak.<br /><br />Levitt and Dubner offer a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems, whether your interest lies in minor lifehacks or major global reforms. As always, no topic is off-limits. They range from business to philanthropy to sports to politics, all with the goal of retraining your brain. Along the way, you’ll learn the secrets of a Japanese hot-dog-eating champion, the reason an Australian doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, and why Nigerian e-mail scammers make a point of saying they’re from Nigeria.<br /><br />Some of the steps toward thinking like a Freak:<br /><br />First, put away your moral compass—because it’s hard to see a problem clearly if you’ve already decided what to do about it.<br />Learn to say “I don’t know”—for until you can admit what you don’t yet know, it’s virtually impossible to learn what you need to.<br />Think like a child—because you’ll come up with better ideas and ask better questions.<br />Take a master class in incentives—because for better or worse, incentives rule our world.<br />Learn to persuade people who don’t want to be persuaded—because being right is rarely enough to carry the day.<br />Learn to appreciate the upside of quitting—because you can’t solve tomorrow’s problem if you aren’t willing to abandon today’s dud.<br />Levitt and Dubner plainly see the world like no one else. Now you can too. Never before have such iconoclastic thinkers been so revealing—and so much fun to read."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""798"",""name"":""Steven D.

Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans. <p> Lewis was in the room with the A's top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, <i>Moneyball</i> is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can't-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (<i>Liar's Poker</i>, <i>The New New Thing</i>), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane's economic approach makes <i>Moneyball</i> an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. <i>--John Moe</i></p>"",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""776"",""name"":""Michael   Lewis"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1317447168p5/776.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1317447168p2/776.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/776.Michael_Lewis"",""average_rating"":""4.14"",""ratings_count"":""625105"",""text_reviews_count"":""34369""}},""published"":""2004"",""work"":{""id"":""416305"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.6lJ4A0AJRJwgkJqbX6ZJcQ""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018201179"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:24:22 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:24:22 -0700 2018,0,"

Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.<br /><br />But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, <i>different.</i><br /><br />Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""3319233"",""name"":""Phil Knight"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1541244521p5/3319233.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1541244521p2/3319233.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3319233.Phil_Knight"",""average_rating"":""4.47"",""ratings_count"":""158124"",""text_reviews_count"":""10767""}},""published"":""2016"",""work"":{""id"":""4077583"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ampX9EVvHFS47HxngL6WCw""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018204546"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:27:45 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:27:46 -0700 2018,0,"

Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?<br /><br />When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.<br /><br />In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form.

Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples and drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H. Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible “choice architecture” to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""65483"",""name"":""Richard H.
