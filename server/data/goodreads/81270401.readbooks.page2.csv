Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?<br /><br />While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's \""Hell You Talmbout.\""<br /><br />Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know.

Shannon Lee Simmons shows you how to create a financial plan that will let you spend knowing you’ll be ready for the future</strong><strong></strong><br /><br />Managing your money can be frustrating and confusing. Life is expensive. It doesn’t matter if you make $40,000 or $140,000 a year, it can feel like you’re constantly broke. Can you afford that new car, that vacation, that night out? You think so, but it feels impossible to know. And rigid budgets that force you to spend your money in unrealistic ways (like $9.50 per week for pants) don’t make things any clearer.<br /><br />But what if there was a new way to manage your money? One that left you certain you had your bases covered—both for your monthly bills and your future retirement—and then let you <em>enjoy</em> your money by spending it. (Yes, we just said that.)<br /><br />Enter Shannon Lee Simmons, a totally new voice in the world of personal finance, one who understands the new and very real pressures to survive modern life and keep up in the age of social media. Shannon doesn’t lecture, judge or patronize. The founder of the wildly popular New School of Finance, Shannon recognized that most of her thousands of clients felt broke, no matter what their income. And feeling broke can be as bad as actually being broke, because it leads to overspending and misery.<br /><br /><em>Worry-Free Money </em>takes a fresh approach to finances, looking at the <em>root cause</em> of the pressure to spend and showing why traditional budgets don’t work. It is a deeply practical book that will help you break the cycle of guilt, understand why you overspend and find hope—and fun—in getting your money under control."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""16794504"",""name"":""Shannon Lee Simmons"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1510324934p5/16794504.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1510324934p2/16794504.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16794504.Shannon_Lee_Simmons"",""average_rating"":""4.33"",""ratings_count"":""900"",""text_reviews_count"":""139""}},""published"":""2017"",""work"":{""id"":""56288735"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.dVU0P6wgp1UZqdqbuYvyUA""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""2658813817"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Mon Oct 14 06:52:54 -0700 2019,Mon Oct 14 06:52:55 -0700 2019,1,"

In <i>Scaling Up</i>, Harnish and his team share practical tools and techniques for building an industry-dominating business. These approaches have been honed from over three decades of advising tens of thousands of CEOs and executives and helping them navigate the increasing complexities (and weight) that come with scaling up a venture. This book is written so everyone -- from frontline employees to senior executives -- can get aligned in contributing to the growth of a firm. There's no reason to do it alone, yet many top leaders feel like they are the ones dragging the rest of the organization up the S-curve of growth. The goal of this book is to help you turn what feels like an anchor into wind at your back -- creating a company where the team is engaged; the customers are doing your marketing; and everyone is making money. To accomplish this, <i>Scaling Up</i> focuses on the four major decision areas every company must get right: People, Strategy, Execution, and Cash. The book includes a series of new one-page tools including the updated One-Page Strategic Plan and the Rockefeller Habits ChecklistTM, which more than 40,000 firms around the globe have used to scale their companies successfully -- many to $1 billion and beyond. Running a business is ultimately about freedom. <i>Scaling Up</i> shows business leaders how to get their organizations moving in sync to create something significant and enjoy the ride."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""9949"",""name"":""Verne Harnish"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9949.Verne_Harnish"",""average_rating"":""4.16"",""ratings_count"":""6016"",""text_reviews_count"":""334""}},""published"":""2014"",""work"":{""id"":""41554067"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1._AT2PRb9W8wKuz3Qr5EU0Q""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""2653627174"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Wed Oct 09 14:17:34 -0700 2019,Wed Oct 09 14:17:35 -0700 2019,1,"

This book was wonderful education for people, education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.<br /><br />But not everyone understands Stephen Covey’s model fully well, or maybe there are some people who haven’t read it yet. This is definitely true because we still see so much failure all around us. Now, I am not saying that by using Covey’s model, or anyone else’s model for that matter, you can become a sure-shot success, but at least we should have seen many more successes around us already judging by the number of copies the book has sold! So, where is the shortcoming?<br /><br />There are two main problems here, and we are talking only about the people who have read the book already. The first problem is that most people are too lazy to implement the ideals of Stephen Covey in their lives. They consider his masterpiece of a book as a mere coffee-table book or a book that you use for light reading when you are traveling and then forget all about it. They do not realize that this book contains life-changing information. Or, they take the information and do not make the effort to actually utilize it so that it becomes knowledge for them.<br /><br />The second problem is that a lot of people have a myopic view of Covey’s ideals. These are people who are impressed by the book already. If you ask them what the seven habits are, they can rattle them off end to end, but then they miss the larger picture. They do not understand that Covey was trying to tell more than he wrote in words. There are hidden implications in this book, yes, and a lot of people have just failed to see through them.<br /><br />That is what we are trying to do. We are trying to show you how Covey’s book, or rather, his model, was a complete model in itself. There was nothing amiss about it. If you implement it, there should be no aspect of your life that should go untouched. The only thing is that you have to understand these ideals and try to implement them in your life.<br /><br />But, before we barge into that area, it is extremely important to understand what these ideals are. What was the model that was propounded by Stephen Covey in his mega-famous book? We shall begin by trying to understand his model first, and then interpret it in such a way that it pertains to every aspect of our life"",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""1538"",""name"":""Stephen R.

In these pages, I’ve tried to do this.” —Bruce Springsteen, from the pages of <i>Born to Run</i><br /><br />In 2009, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band performed at the Super Bowl’s halftime show. The experience was so exhilarating that Bruce decided to write about it. That’s how this extraordinary autobiography began.<br /> <br />Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life, bringing to these pages the same honesty, humor, and originality found in his songs.<br /> <br />He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as “The Big Bang”: seeing Elvis Presley’s debut on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work, and shows us why the song “Born to Run” reveals more than we previously realized.<br /> <br /><i>Born to Run</i> will be revelatory for anyone who has ever enjoyed Bruce Springsteen, but this book is much more than a legendary rock star’s memoir. This is a book for workers and dreamers, parents and children, lovers and loners, artists, freaks, or anyone who has ever wanted to be baptized in the holy river of rock and roll.<br /> <br />Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep. Like many of his songs (“Thunder Road,” “Badlands,” “Darkness on the Edge of Town,” “The River,” “Born in the U.S.A.,” “The Rising,” and “The Ghost of Tom Joad,” to name just a few), Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography is written with the lyricism of a singular songwriter and the wisdom of a man who has thought deeply about his experiences."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""236007"",""name"":""Bruce Springsteen"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1488228224p5/236007.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1488228224p2/236007.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/236007.Bruce_Springsteen"",""average_rating"":""4.16"",""ratings_count"":""40715"",""text_reviews_count"":""5032""}},""published"":""2016"",""work"":{""id"":""49302622"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.JVYAmDOvvCIPq-d8EiboUA""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2523391482"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Sat Jun 29 14:58:11 -0700 2019,Sat Jun 29 14:58:12 -0700 2019,1,"

He argues that Musk is an amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs.

In Zero to One, legendary entrepreneur and investor Peter Thiel shows how we can find singular ways to create those new things. <br /><br />Thiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we’re too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.<br /><br />Doing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. Tomorrow’s champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today’s marketplace.

He often came across as a man possessed, holding forth on culture and politics while mixing in personal revelations – all with mercurial, tongue-twisting intensity as he inhabited and shed one character after another with lightning speed.<br /><br />But as Dave Itzkoff shows in this revelatory biography, Williams’s comic brilliance masked a deep well of conflicting emotions and self-doubt, which he drew upon in his comedy and in celebrated films like <i>Dead Poets Society; Good Morning, Vietnam; The Fisher King; Aladdin</i>; and <i>Mrs. Doubtfire</i>, where he showcased his limitless gift for improvisation to bring to life a wide range of characters. And in <i>Good Will Hunting</i> he gave an intense and controlled performance that revealed the true range of his talent.<br /><br />Itzkoff also shows how Williams struggled mightily with addiction and depression – topics he discussed openly while performing and during interviews – and with a debilitating condition at the end of his life that affected him in ways his fans never knew. Drawing on more than a hundred original interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, as well as extensive archival research, <i>Robin</i> is a fresh and original look at a man whose work touched so many lives."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""422289"",""name"":""Dave Itzkoff"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/422289.Dave_Itzkoff"",""average_rating"":""4.01"",""ratings_count"":""13070"",""text_reviews_count"":""1715""}},""published"":"""",""work"":{""id"":""58364536"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.X0vgJFe36p9mtDFfuGSaug""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2450397985"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 30 10:14:22 -0700 2019,Tue Apr 30 10:14:23 -0700 2019,1,"

Stars and directors have seen their power dwindle, while writers and producers lift their best techniques from TV, comic books, and the toy biz. The future of Hollywood is being written by powerful corporate brands like Marvel, Amazon, Netflix, and Lego, as well as censors in China.<br /><br />Ben Fritz chronicles this dramatic shakeup with unmatched skill, bringing equal fluency to both the financial and entertainment aspects of Hollywood. He dives deeply into the fruits of the Sony hack to show how the previous model, long a creative and commercial success, lost its way. And he looks ahead through interviews with dozens of key players at Disney, Marvel, Netflix, Amazon, Imax, and others to discover how they have reinvented the business. He shows us, for instance, how Marvel replaced stars with “universes,” and how Disney remade itself in Apple’s image and reaped enormous profits.<br /><br />But despite the destruction of the studios’ traditional playbook, Fritz argues that these seismic shifts signal the dawn of a new heyday for film. <i>The Big Picture</i> shows the first glimmers of this new golden age through the eyes of the creative mavericks who are defining what our movies will look like in the new era."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""80923"",""name"":""Ben Fritz"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1541449465p5/80923.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1541449465p2/80923.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/80923.Ben_Fritz"",""average_rating"":""4.00"",""ratings_count"":""1296"",""text_reviews_count"":""168""}},""published"":"""",""work"":{""id"":""60125687"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.d9s8IeBQ8sSgRv1iIDrhIQ""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2378405368"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,Tue Feb 26 10:19:51 -0800 2019,Thu Feb 28 20:02:07 -0800 2019,Tue Feb 26 10:19:50 -0800 2019,Thu Feb 28 20:02:26 -0800 2019,1,"

Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life.<br /><br /> As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights:<br /><br /> <b>• <i>For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. </i></b>You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations.<br /> <b>• <i>Ethical rules aren’t universal</i>.</b> You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general.<br /> <b>• <i>Minorities, not majorities, run the world. </i></b>The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others.<br /> <b>• <i>You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot</i>.</b> “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets.<br /> <b>• <i>Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find)</i>.</b> A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines.<br /> <b>• <i>True religion is commitment, not just faith</i>.</b> How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it.<br /><br />The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.”"",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""21559"",""name"":""Nassim Nicholas Taleb"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p5/21559.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1206025993p2/21559.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/21559.Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb"",""average_rating"":""4.00"",""ratings_count"":""198778"",""text_reviews_count"":""12973""}},""published"":""2018"",""work"":{""id"":""57645736"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ty-ArUdPIHFLg7zWHr9gkQ""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2368620608"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,Fri Feb 15 07:08:17 -0800 2019,Thu Feb 21 06:16:34 -0800 2019,Fri Feb 15 07:08:17 -0800 2019,Thu Feb 21 06:16:34 -0800 2019,1,"
