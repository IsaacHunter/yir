Just about everyone thinks they know how they got there. Just about everyone is wrong. <br /><br />For all that's been written about the Four over the last two decades, no one has captured their power and staggering success as insightfully as Scott Galloway.<br /><br />Instead of buying the myths these compa-nies broadcast, Galloway asks fundamental questions. How did the Four infiltrate our lives so completely that they're almost impossible to avoid (or boycott)? Why does the stock market forgive them for sins that would destroy other firms? And as they race to become the world's first trillion-dollar company, can anyone chal-lenge them?<br /><br />In the same irreverent style that has made him one of the world's most celebrated business professors, Galloway deconstructs the strategies of the Four that lurk beneath their shiny veneers. He shows how they manipulate the fundamental emotional needs that have driven us since our ancestors lived in caves, at a speed and scope others can't match. And he reveals how you can apply the lessons of their ascent to your own business or career.<br /><br />Whether you want to compete with them, do business with them, or simply live in the world they dominate, you need to understand the Four."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""14343275"",""name"":""Scott Galloway"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1514575344p5/14343275.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1514575344p2/14343275.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14343275.Scott_Galloway"",""average_rating"":""3.87"",""ratings_count"":""14778"",""text_reviews_count"":""1464""}},""published"":""2017"",""work"":{""id"":""55533053"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Pib64_PNMhjEbMedJcqI1g""}}",4,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""409098290"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,Tue Dec 15 19:00:13 -0800 2020,Sun Dec 20 17:36:18 -0800 2020,Tue Dec 15 19:00:13 -0800 2020,Sun Dec 20 17:36:23 -0800 2020,1,"

When Carreyrou, working at <i>The Wall Street Journal,</i> got a tip from a former Theranos employee and started asking questions, both Carreyrou and the <i>Journal</i> were threatened with lawsuits. Undaunted, the newspaper ran the first of dozens of Theranos articles in late 2015.

And what about individual potential: what defines a person’s limits?<br /><br />For years, physiology determined the answer: heart size, lung capacity, and muscle strength. But over the past decade, a wave of dramatic findings in the cutting-edge science of endurance has completely overturned our understanding of human limitation. <i>Endure</i> widely disseminates these findings for the first time: It’s the brain that dictates how far we can go—which means we can always push ourselves further.<br /><br />Hutchinson presents an overview of science’s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs’ legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits (like a car with a brick on its gas pedal, we go until the tank runs out of gas), he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals—whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid—and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.<br /><br />An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology—brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging—and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today and shows how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance—and get the most out of their bodies."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""5038088"",""name"":""Alex  Hutchinson"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1518724873p5/5038088.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1518724873p2/5038088.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5038088.Alex_Hutchinson"",""average_rating"":""4.12"",""ratings_count"":""8987"",""text_reviews_count"":""868""}},""published"":""2018"",""work"":{""id"":""56364072"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.PjLYDTbZOLz1Dj1ZyF8KAQ""}}",5,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""409098290"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Tue Dec 15 18:57:49 -0800 2020,Tue Dec 15 18:57:55 -0800 2020,1,"

His students are smart and hardworking, but they struggle with life's biggest questions, just like the rest of us. What's the formula for a life well lived? How can you have a meaningful career, not just a lucrative one? Is work/life balance really possible? What does it take to make a long-term relationship succeed?<br /><br />Galloway explores these and many other questions in the take-no-prisoners style that has made him a sought-after commentator and YouTube star. For example...<br /><br /><b>If (Money In) - (Money Out) &gt; 0, you're rich.</b><br />The definition of \""rich\"" is income greater than your burn rate. My dad and his wife receive about $50K/year and spend $40K. They are rich. I have friends who earn more than $1 million, but with several children in private schools, an ex-wife, a home in the Hamptons, and the lifestyle of a master of the universe, they spend nearly all of it. They are poor.<br /><br /><b>Compound interest = the key to relationships.</b><br />Most of us know how compound interest works with money, but don't recognize its power in other spheres. Make small investments in the people you care about, every day. Take a ton of pictures, text your friends stupid things, check in with old friends, express admiration to coworkers, and tell your loved ones that you love them. The payoff is small, until it becomes immense.<br /><br /><b>Serendipity = a function of courage.</b><br />My willingness to endure rejection from universities, peers, investors, and women has been hugely rewarding. Asking a VC for money is nothing compared to approaching a woman midday in a beach chair, sitting with another woman and a guy, and opening. Nothing wonderful will happen without taking a risk and subjecting yourself to rejection.<br /><br /><b>Cool vacation &gt; Cool car.</b><br />Studies show people overestimate the happiness that things will bring them, and underestimate the long-term positive effect of experiences. Invest in experiences over things. Drive a Hyundai, and take your spouse to Australia.<br /><br /><i>The Algebra of Happiness</i> is perfect for any graduate, or for anyone who feels adrift."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""14343275"",""name"":""Scott Galloway"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1514575344p5/14343275.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1514575344p2/14343275.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14343275.Scott_Galloway"",""average_rating"":""3.87"",""ratings_count"":""14778"",""text_reviews_count"":""1464""}},""published"":""2019"",""work"":{""id"":""66663113"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.jnWRTP42NhmjQ1KLnD3DGw""}}",4,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""409098290"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Tue Dec 15 19:00:36 -0800 2020,Tue Dec 15 19:00:42 -0800 2020,1,"

Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?<br /><br />While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's \""Hell You Talmbout.\""<br /><br />Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know.
