Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments.<br /><br />Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not genius, but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own character lab and set out to test her theory.<br /><br />Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers; from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of <i>The New Yorker</i> to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.<br /><br />Winningly personal, insightful, and even life-changing, <i>Grit</i> is a book about what goes through your head when you fall down, and how that not talent or luck makes all the difference."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""14132767"",""name"":""Angela Duckworth"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1461691947p5/14132767.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1461691947p2/14132767.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14132767.Angela_Duckworth"",""average_rating"":""4.08"",""ratings_count"":""73400"",""text_reviews_count"":""5722""}},""published"":""2016"",""work"":{""id"":""45670634"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.9G7lJooEl8Kowf9AOMimsg""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2397812794"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Sat Mar 16 17:39:50 -0700 2019,Sat Mar 16 17:39:51 -0700 2019,1,"

Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br />  <br /><i>Between the World and Me </i>is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, <i>Between the World and Me </i>clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""1214964"",""name"":""Ta-Nehisi Coates"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1595285597p5/1214964.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1595285597p2/1214964.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1214964.Ta_Nehisi_Coates"",""average_rating"":""4.27"",""ratings_count"":""400422"",""text_reviews_count"":""41133""}},""published"":""2015"",""work"":{""id"":""44848425"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.F-n-hb4HqoKqonNt8NpNkg""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2078656536"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Fri Jun 22 07:17:49 -0700 2018,Fri Jun 22 07:18:55 -0700 2018,1,"

Most marriage books barely mention friendship. Most marriage books use “intimacy” as code for “sex.” This is not one of those books.<br /><br /><br />In Real Marriage, Pastor Mark Driscoll and his wife, Grace, share how they have struggled and how they have found healing through the power of the only reliable source: the Bible. They believe friendship is fundamental to marriage but not easy to maintain. So they offer practical advice on how to make your spouse your best friend – and keep it that way. And they know from experience that sex-related issues need to be addressed directly.<br /><br /><br />Five chapters are dedicated to answering questions like:<br /><br /><br /><br />Should I confess my pre-marital sexual sin to my spouse?<br />Is it okay to have a “work spouse”?<br />What does the Bible say about masturbation and oral sex?<br />Stunningly honest and vulnerable, Real Marriage is like a personal counseling session with a couple you cannot surprise, you cannot shock into silence, who will respond to every question with wisdom, humility, and realism.<br /><br /><br />If you want to have a long-lasting, fulfilling marriage you should read this book. Wrestle with this book. Pray over this book. Share this book. And discover how God can use it to change your life.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Endorsements</strong>:<br /><br /><br />“If you’re married or plan to be someday, do yourself a favor and read every page of this book.” —DRS.

I highly recommend this book.” —ANDY STANLEY author of The Grace of God and Senior Pastor, North Point Community Church<br /><br /><br />\""One of my greatest concerns is that culture is going to continually define and redefine what marriage is and is not, and the church is going to simply sit on the sidelines and react rather than seeking to actually become proactive by confidently teaching what the Bible has to say about it.  That is why I am so thankful that Mark and Grace Driscoll wrote this book.  Their approach to marriage, its benefits and challenges are transparent and challenging and I honestly believe that every married couple who will work through what they lead us through in this book will not just merely have a marriage that survives in this world but rather thrives in it.\"" — PERRY NOBLE Senior Pastor, NewSpring<strong> </strong>Church<br /><br /><br />\""Our thanks to Mark and Grace Driscoll who have served this generation well by tastefully but boldly addressing the real issues facing real marriages.

In college, I ran against Kenyans, and wondered whether endurance genes might have traveled with them from East Africa. At the same time, I began to notice that a training group on my team could consist of five men who run next to one another, stride for stride, day after day, and nonetheless turn out five entirely different runners. How could this be?</i><br /><br />We all knew a star athlete in high school. The one who made it look so easy. He was the starting quarterback and shortstop; she was the all-state point guard and high-jumper. <i>Naturals</i>. Or were they?<br /><br />The debate is as old as physical competition. Are stars like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Serena Williams genetic freaks put on Earth to dominate their respective sports? Or are they simply normal people who overcame their biological limits through sheer force of will and obsessive training?<br />The truth is far messier than a simple dichotomy between nature and nurture. In the decade since the sequencing of the human genome, researchers have slowly begun to uncover how the relationship between biological endowments and a competitor’s training environment affects athleticism. Sports scientists have gradually entered the era of modern genetic research.<br /><br />In this controversial and engaging exploration of athletic success, <i>Sports Illustrated</i> senior writer David Epstein tackles the great nature vs. nurture debate and traces how far science has come in solving this great riddle. He investigates the so-called 10,000-hour rule to uncover whether rigorous and consistent practice from a young age is the only route to athletic excellence.<br /><br />Along the way, Epstein dispels many of our perceptions about why top athletes excel. He shows why some skills that we assume are innate, like the bullet-fast reactions of a baseball or cricket batter, are not, and why other characteristics that we assume are entirely voluntary, like an athlete’s will to train, might in fact have important genetic components.<br /><br />This subject necessarily involves digging deep into sensitive topics like race and gender. Epstein explores controversial questions such as:<br />Are black athletes genetically predetermined to dominate both sprinting and distance running, and are their abilities influenced by Africa’s geography?<br />Are there genetic reasons to separate male and female athletes in competition?<br />Should we test the genes of young children to determine if they are destined for stardom?<br />Can genetic testing determine who is at risk of injury, brain damage, or even death on the field?<br />Through on-the-ground reporting from below the equator and above the Arctic Circle, revealing conversations with leading scientists and Olympic champions, and interviews with athletes who have rare genetic mutations or physical traits, Epstein forces us to rethink the very nature of athleticism.<br /> "",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""7164089"",""name"":""David   Epstein"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1545945759p5/7164089.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1545945759p2/7164089.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7164089.David_Epstein"",""average_rating"":""4.17"",""ratings_count"":""37230"",""text_reviews_count"":""3567""}},""published"":""2013"",""work"":{""id"":""22018671"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.ZLEXjtXC9o9dezgzB6ojlg""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2057111070"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,Wed May 30 10:01:23 -0700 2018,Fri Jun 01 20:59:41 -0700 2018,Wed May 30 10:01:23 -0700 2018,Fri Jun 01 21:00:15 -0700 2018,1,"

Bestseller lists are filled with doubters. But what happens when you actually doubt your doubts?<br /><br />Although a vocal minority continues to attack the Christian faith, for most Americans, faith is a large part of their lives: 86 percent of Americans refer to themselves as religious, and 75 percent of all Americans consider themselves Christians. So how should they respond to these passionate, learned, and persuasive books that promote science and secularism over religion and faith? For years, Tim Keller has compiled a list of the most frequently voiced “doubts” skeptics bring to his Manhattan church. And in <i>The Reason for God</i>, he single-handedly dismantles each of them. Written with atheists, agnostics, and skeptics in mind, Keller also provides an intelligent platform on which true believers can stand their ground when bombarded by the backlash. <i>The Reason for God</i> challenges such ideology at its core and points to the true path and purpose of Christianity.<br /><br />Why is there suffering in the world? How could a loving God send people to Hell? Why isn’t Christianity more inclusive? Shouldn’t the Christian God be a god of love? How can one religion be “right” and the rest “wrong”? Why have so many wars been fought in the name of God? These are just a few of the questions even ardent believers wrestle with today. In this book, Tim Keller uses literature, philosophy, real-life conversations and reasoning, and even pop culture to explain how faith in a Christian God is a soundly rational belief, held by thoughtful people of intellectual integrity with a deep compassion for those who truly want to know the truth."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""847789"",""name"":""Timothy J.

Based on more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two years--as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues--Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. Isaacson's portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values. Steve Jobs is the inspiration for the movie of the same name starring Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, and Jeff Daniels, directed by Danny Boyle with a screenplay by Aaron Sorkin."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""7111"",""name"":""Walter Isaacson"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222433p5/7111.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1192222433p2/7111.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7111.Walter_Isaacson"",""average_rating"":""4.12"",""ratings_count"":""1350249"",""text_reviews_count"":""31355""}},""published"":""2011"",""work"":{""id"":""16005831"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.MvliEan8p7Xgfe4QrGmMLw""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""3316590047"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,Wed Jan 01 00:00:00 -0800 2014,Wed Dec 09 20:15:32 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 09 20:15:59 -0800 2020,1,"

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.<br /><br />Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives—and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i> will transform the way you think about thinking."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""72401"",""name"":""Daniel Kahneman"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1605420588p5/72401.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1605420588p2/72401.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/72401.Daniel_Kahneman"",""average_rating"":""4.16"",""ratings_count"":""330413"",""text_reviews_count"":""11733""}},""published"":""2011"",""work"":{""id"":""16402639"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.fgboBCvf-38t9A7bG3aJrg""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619097"",""name"":""physical"",""review_shelf_id"":""2194802193"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Wed Oct 03 07:03:55 -0700 2018,Wed Oct 03 07:03:56 -0700 2018,1,"

Now, to mark the NHL's 99th anniversary, Wayne Gretzky has written the story of our game.</b><br /><br />No one has been as close to the game as Wayne Gretzky. When he first laced up skates in the NHL, he changed the league. And by the time he had hung up his skates, he had re-written the record book.<br /><br />There can be no doubt what he means to the game. What we haven't seen is what the game means to him. For the first time, Wayne Gretzky will tell us about the NHL's great moments from his point of view. We will meet the people who inspired him and motivated him. We'll read the stories of the players who ignited his imagination, just as Gretzky himself inspired the dreams of so many young players and fans.<br /><br />Seen through the eyes of the player whose name has come to stand for greatness in the game of hockey, <i>99: Stories of the Game</i> brings to life the NHL's glorious past, from its fierce early battles on natural ice, through its mythical golden era, when the Howes and Richards, Hulls and Orrs defined greatness, through the unforgettable dynasties in Montreal, New York, and of course, Edmonton, through to the present day.<br /><br />Written with all the insight of someone who knows what it feels like when your lungs burn at the end of a long shift, and the pain of bruises at the end of a long playoff series, who knows what it feels like to fall short against a bitter rival, and also the incomparable feeling of lifting the Stanley Cup over your head, <i>99: Stories of the Game</i> doesn't just tell the history of the NHL's 99 years. It relives them."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""240132"",""name"":""Wayne Gretzky"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1485312835p5/240132.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1485312835p2/240132.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/240132.Wayne_Gretzky"",""average_rating"":""3.91"",""ratings_count"":""4663"",""text_reviews_count"":""436""}},""published"":""2016"",""work"":{""id"":""49782578"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Ea56ZkTlwPqn_UZDDOD7VA""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018205657"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:29:01 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:29:02 -0700 2018,0,"
