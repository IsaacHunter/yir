Every day we find ourselves in situations where we need to say No–to people at work, at home, and in our communities–because No is the word we must use to protect ourselves and to stand up for everything and everyone that matters to us. <br /><br />But as we all know, the wrong No can also destroy what we most value by alienating and angering people. That’s why saying No the right way is crucial. The secret to saying No without destroying relationships lies in the art of the Positive No, a proven technique that anyone can learn. <br /><br />This indispensable book gives you a simple three-step method for saying a Positive No. It will show you how to assert and defend your key interests; how to make your No firm and strong; how to resist the other side’s aggression and manipulation; and how to do all this while still getting to Yes. In the end, the Positive No will help you get not just to any Yes but to the right Yes, the one that truly serves your interests. <br /><br />Based on William Ury’s celebrated Harvard University course for managers and professionals, <b>The Power of a Positive No</b> offers concrete advice and practical examples for saying No in virtually any situation. Whether you need to say No to your customer or your coworker, your employee or your CEO, your child or your spouse, you will find in this book the secret to saying No clearly, respectfully, and effectively. <br /><br />In today’s world of high stress and limitless choices, the pressure to give in and say Yes grows greater every day, producing overload and overwork, expanding e-mail and eroding ethics. Never has No been more needed. A Positive No has the power to profoundly transform our lives by enabling us to say Yes to what counts–our own needs, values, and priorities. <br /><br />Understood this way, No is the new Yes. And the Positive No may be the most valuable life skill you’ll ever learn!"",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""2839"",""name"":""William Ury"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1217281998p5/2839.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1217281998p2/2839.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2839.William_Ury"",""average_rating"":""3.95"",""ratings_count"":""68598"",""text_reviews_count"":""2415""}},""published"":""2007"",""work"":{""id"":""2446427"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.eT2LGK75CxDHFhav8de4WA""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018202681"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:25:58 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:25:59 -0700 2018,0,"

The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.<br /><br />The Challenge<br />Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. <br /><br />But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? <br /><br />The Study<br />For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?<br /><br />The Standards<br />Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. <br /><br />The Comparisons<br />The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great. What was different? Why did one set of companies become truly great performers while the other set remained only good? <br /><br />The Findings<br />The findings of the Good to Great study will surprise many readers and shed light on virtually every area of management strategy and practice. The findings include:<br />Level 5 Leaders: The research team was shocked to discover the type of leadership required to achieve greatness.<br /><br />The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles): To go from good to great requires transcending the curse of competence.<br /><br />A Culture of Discipline: When you combine a culture of discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy of great results. Technology Accelerators: Good-to-great companies think differently about the role of technology.<br /><br />The Flywheel and the Doom Loop: Those who launch radical change programs and wrenching restructurings will almost certainly fail to make the leap."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""2826"",""name"":""James C.

Now, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis gives us the first full-length biography of Schulz: at once a creation story, a portrait of a hidden American genius, and a chronicle contrasting the private man with the central role he played in shaping the national imagination. The son of a barber, Schulz was born in Minnesota to modest, working class roots. In 1943, just three days after his mother′s tragic death from cancer, Schulz, a private in the army, shipped out for boot camp and the war in Europe. The sense of shock and separation never left him. And these early experiences would shape his entire life.<br /><br />With Peanuts, Schulz embedded adult ideas in a world of small children to remind the reader that character flaws and childhood wounds are with us always. It was the central truth of his own life, that as the adults we′ve become and as the children we always will be, we can free ourselves, if only we can see the humour in the predicaments of funny-looking kids. Schulz′s Peanuts profoundly influenced the country in the second half of the 20th century. But the strip was anchored in the collective experience and hardships of Schulz′s generation-the generation that survived the Great Depression and liberated Europe and the Pacific and came home to build the post-war world."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""54620"",""name"":""David Michaelis"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363437035p5/54620.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1363437035p2/54620.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/54620.David_Michaelis"",""average_rating"":""4.04"",""ratings_count"":""12076"",""text_reviews_count"":""1026""}},""published"":""2007"",""work"":{""id"":""188791"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.i9AiuGHJ2LgwWHAsg37Ghg""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018204949"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:28:13 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:28:14 -0700 2018,0,"

Never again will you think about thinking the same way.<br /><br />Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant - in the blink of an eye - that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work - in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? <br /><br />In <i>Blink</i> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of \""blink\"": the election of Warren Harding; \""New Coke\""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of \""thin-slicing\"" - filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""1439"",""name"":""Malcolm Gladwell"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p5/1439.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p2/1439.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell"",""average_rating"":""4.01"",""ratings_count"":""2193626"",""text_reviews_count"":""86250""}},""published"":""2007"",""work"":{""id"":""1180927"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.qYWy3fKK-YHr5-a-JLzv2Q""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018202216"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:25:27 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:25:28 -0700 2018,0,"

Here, too, are his movie and television appearances, from the classic \"" Three Amigos!\"" to his Emmy-nominated role in \""Damages,\"" as well as his stage productions, including his Tony Award winning performance in \""Little Me.\"" Throughout, such friends and luminaries as Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, John Candy, Gilda Radner, Lorne Michaels, Nora Ephron, Frank Sinatra, and others share the spotlight.<br /><br />This deeply private man brings us into the circle of his family life, from raising his children to the legendary parties he and his wife hosted in their Los Angeles home. He recounts the pain of losing a brother and both parents by the time he was twenty and of the devastating death of Nancy, his wife of thirty years, in 2010. Despite the hardships, Short s life has been full of laughter, and he remains perennially upbeat. In this wise and entertaining memoir, he shares his irrepressible joy.\"""",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""7868515"",""name"":""Martin  Short"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1468719719p5/7868515.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1468719719p2/7868515.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7868515.Martin_Short"",""average_rating"":""4.06"",""ratings_count"":""9413"",""text_reviews_count"":""1529""}},""published"":""2014"",""work"":{""id"":""37104702"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.xTz48G6yVXKO0pAFk00IKw""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018205245"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:28:32 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:28:33 -0700 2018,0,"

Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.<br /><br />Gladwell introduces us to the particular personality types who are natural pollinators of new ideas and trends, the people who create the phenomenon of word of mouth. He analyzes fashion trends, smoking, children's television, direct mail, and the early days of the American Revolution for clues about making ideas infectious, and visits a religious commune, a successful high-tech company, and one of the world's greatest salesmen to show how to start and sustain social epidemics."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""1439"",""name"":""Malcolm Gladwell"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p5/1439.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1564001739p2/1439.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1439.Malcolm_Gladwell"",""average_rating"":""4.01"",""ratings_count"":""2193626"",""text_reviews_count"":""86250""}},""published"":""2002"",""work"":{""id"":""2124255"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.0gldOhtTZsFxGayFbXajCQ""}}",0,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":[{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""264618742"",""review_shelf_id"":""""},{""exclusive"":""false"",""id"":""264619105"",""name"":""audio"",""review_shelf_id"":""2018201692"",""sortable"":""false""}]}",,,,,Tue Apr 24 17:24:53 -0700 2018,Tue Apr 24 17:24:53 -0700 2018,0,"

In this riveting account, he tells of his journey from a prison cell to Mecca, describing his transition from hoodlum to Muslim minister.

Many critics complained of the book because it merely criticised current philosophies without offering any alternative philosophy. This book is an attempt to answer the challenge. It is the purpose of the writer to attempt an explanation, not of whether the Christian Faith can be believed, but of how he personally has come to believe it. The book is therefore arranged upon the positive principle of a riddle and its answer. It deals first with all the writer's own solitary and sincere speculations and then with the startling style in which they were all suddenly satisfied by the Christian Theology. The writer regards it as amounting to a convincing creed. But if it is not that it is at least a repeated and surprising coincidence."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""7014283"",""name"":""G.K.
