Done right, a talk can electrify a room and transform an audience’s worldview. Done right, a talk is more powerful than anything in written form.<br />         This book explains how the miracle of powerful public speaking is achieved, and equips you to give it your best shot. There is no set formula; no two talks should be the same. The goal is for you to give the talk that only <i>you</i> can give. But don’t be intimidated. You may find it more natural than you think.<br />         Chris Anderson has worked behind the scenes with all the TED speakers who have inspired us the most, and here he shares insights from such favorites as Sir Ken Robinson, Amy Cuddy, Bill Gates, Elizabeth Gilbert, Salman Khan, Dan Gilbert, Mary Roach, Matt Ridley, and dozens more — everything from how to craft your talk’s content to how you can be most effective on stage. This is the 21st-century’s new manual for truly effective communication and it is a must-read for anyone who is ready to create impact with their ideas."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""14161638"",""name"":""Chris J.

Do you want help figuring out who you are and why you're stuck in the same ruts? The Enneagram is an ancient personality typing system with an uncanny accuracy in describing how human beings are wired, both positively and negatively. <br /><br />In <i>The Road Back to You</i> Ian Morgan Cron and Suzanne Stabile forge a unique approach―a practical, comprehensive way of accessing Enneagram wisdom and exploring its connections with Christian spirituality for a deeper knowledge of ourselves, compassion for others, and love for God. Witty and filled with stories, this book allows you to peek inside each of the nine Enneagram types, keeping you turning the pages long after you have read the chapter about your own number. Not only will you learn more about yourself, but you will also start to see the world through other people's eyes, understanding how and why people think, feel, and act the way they do. Beginning with changes you can start making today, the wisdom of the Enneagram can help take you further along into who you really are―leading you into places of spiritual discovery you would never have found on your own, and paving the way to the wiser, more compassionate person you want to become."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""469393"",""name"":""Ian Morgan Cron"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1571173753p5/469393.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1571173753p2/469393.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/469393.Ian_Morgan_Cron"",""average_rating"":""4.23"",""ratings_count"":""36509"",""text_reviews_count"":""3437""}},""published"":""2016"",""work"":{""id"":""48314516"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.NJDUQ4EYqI4Rlju8Fvau2w""}}",5,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""412514512"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Wed Dec 30 10:59:53 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 30 10:59:54 -0800 2020,1,"

Neither of them knew at the time that Ryan was living out a death sentence brought on by a worsening genetic heart defect. Soon it became clear he needed major surgery that could either save his life--or result in his death on the operating table. The young couple prepared for the worst. <br /><br />When Ryan survived, they both realized that they still had a future together. But the near loss changed the way they saw all that would lie ahead. They would live and love fiercely, fighting for each other and for a Christ-centered marriage, every step of the way.<br /><br /><i>Fierce Marriage</i> is their story, but more than that, it is a call for married couples to put God first in their relationship, to measure everything they do and say to each other against what Christ did for them, and to see marriage not just as a relationship they should try to keep healthy but also as one worth fighting for in every situation. With the gospel as their foundation, Ryan and Selena offer hope and practical help for common struggles in marriage, including communication problems, sexual frustration, financial stress, family tension, screen-time disconnection, and unrealistic expectations."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""15398127"",""name"":""Ryan Frederick"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524147208p5/15398127.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1524147208p2/15398127.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15398127.Ryan_Frederick"",""average_rating"":""4.30"",""ratings_count"":""610"",""text_reviews_count"":""113""}},""published"":""2018"",""work"":{""id"":""56463640"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.YJnNHOT6fJ1mg33uBabnXw""}}",5,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""412514512"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Wed Dec 30 10:58:07 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 30 10:58:08 -0800 2020,1,"

James Clear, one of the world's leading experts on habit formation, reveals practical strategies that will teach you exactly how to form good habits, break bad ones, and master the tiny behaviors that lead to remarkable results.<br /><br />If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.<br /><br />Clear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.<br /><br />Learn how to:<br /><b>*</b>  make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);<br /><b>*</b>  overcome a lack of motivation and willpower;<br /><b>*</b>  design your environment to make success easier;<br /><b>*</b>  get back on track when you fall off course;<br />...and much more.<br /><br /><i>Atomic Habits</i> will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""7327369"",""name"":""James Clear"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393075384p5/7327369.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393075384p2/7327369.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7327369.James_Clear"",""average_rating"":""4.35"",""ratings_count"":""144439"",""text_reviews_count"":""11752""}},""published"":"""",""work"":{""id"":""62221762"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.b-26D0ndpgC7ICmWDgP53Q""}}",5,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""412514512"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Wed Dec 30 11:01:17 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 30 11:01:18 -0800 2020,1,"

What's crazy is that God is weighing in on those questions. We just haven't learned to listen. Nathan Finochio believes that God is constantly communicating with this world he's created. We simply aren't following the right advice when it comes to hearing what he has to say.

Grounded in solid research and three decades of entrepreneurial experience, this book has one purpose: to teach you how to be both the boss everyone wants to work for and the high achiever every CEO wants to hire—all without drama, stress, or endless hours in the office<br /> <br />Inspired by Kruse's viral article \""Why Successful Leaders Don't Have an Open Door Policy,\"" this contrarian approach to leadership reveals why you should throw out the rulebook and instead play favorites, crowd your calendar, tell employees everything (even salaries), stay out of meetings, hide your phone, and more. Kruse makes the case for these principles with engaging real-world stories and case studies, and shows how to use this wisdom to buck the trend and become more effective. He also shares applications beyond the office—at home, in sales, in sports, and more. Ultimately, his advice empowers you to focus on what matters, which is the key to success for you, your employees, and your company."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""18701123"",""name"":""Kevin Kruse"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n"",""nophoto"":""true""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18701123.Kevin_Kruse"",""average_rating"":""4.06"",""ratings_count"":""202"",""text_reviews_count"":""30""}},""published"":"""",""work"":{""id"":""67097571"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.1cnMTMJhULqgbWl3y_u2UA""}}",4,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""412514512"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Wed Dec 30 11:04:34 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 30 11:04:35 -0800 2020,1,"

Do you avoid certain family members and colleagues because of bitter, festering tension that you can't figure out how to address?</b>\n  <br />\n  <b></b>\n  <br />\n  <b>Now, finally, there's a solution: a secret framework that frees you from the trap of unproductive conflict and pointless arguing forever.</b>\n</b><br /><br />If the threat of raised voices, emotional outbursts, and public discord makes you want to hide under the conference room table, or if you're simply sick of unresolved arguments that never produce useful results, you're not alone. Conflict, or the fear of it, can be devastating. And the process of minimizing, deflecting, or avoiding difficult people can leave you brimming with repressed emotions.<br /><br />But as this powerful book argues, conflict doesn't have to be unpleasant. In fact, properly channeled, conflict can be the most powerful tool we have at our disposal for deepening relationships, solving problems, and coming up with new ideas.<br /><br />As the mastermind behind some of the highest-performing teams at Amazon, Twitter, and Slack, Buster Benson spent decades facilitating hard conversations in stressful environments. He found that even smart, eloquent people struggled to stay calm and keep their heads clear when differences of opinion arose. So he set out to find a better way to argue, staging a succession of experiments and informal debates, and studying the participants closely. He took note of the scripts people defaulted to and the chain reactions they caused. Slowly, patterns began to emerge.<br /><br />Buster's findings shattered his assumptions about what makes some arguments productive and others not, and dramatically improved his relationships at work, with his wife, and with strangers online. In this book, Buster reveals the psychological underpinnings of awkward, unproductive conflict, and the critical habits anyone can learn to avoid it. Armed with a deeper understanding of how arguments work and why, you'll be able to:<br /><br /><b>*</b> Remain confident when you're put on the spot<br /><b>*</b> Diffuse tense moments with a few strategic questions<br /><b>*</b> Facilitate creative solutions even when your team has radically different perspectives<br /><b>*</b> Get through to the most stubborn people by understanding their motivations<br /><br />Freed of your fear of disagreement, you'll find yourself eager to engage with intimidating people and uncomfortable ideas. You'll end up having fewer repetitive, predictable fights, not because you're avoiding or squashing them, but because you're finally able to identify your biases, listen with an open mind, and communicate well. As your confidence grows, you'll shake off lingering memories of interactions that made you feel tongue-tied or incapable, knowing that it's in your power to steer the conversation wherever you want it."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""18935665"",""name"":""Buster Benson"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1570703435p5/18935665.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1570703435p2/18935665.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18935665.Buster_Benson"",""average_rating"":""3.65"",""ratings_count"":""547"",""text_reviews_count"":""91""}},""published"":""2019"",""work"":{""id"":""68791542"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.Xwf33fPIfJ07VnCV-ogS-A""}}",4,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""412514512"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Wed Dec 30 11:02:52 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 30 11:02:53 -0800 2020,1,"
