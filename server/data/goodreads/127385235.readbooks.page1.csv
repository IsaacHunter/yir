But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br /><br />After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.<br /><br />Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls, and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying than he ever could have imagined.<br /><br />Full of sympathetic characters, wildly imaginative situations, and countless exciting details, the first installment in the series assembles an unforgettable magical world and sets the stage for many high-stakes adventures to come."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""1077326"",""name"":""J.K.

Americans have built an empire on the idea of “race,” a falsehood that damages us all but falls most heavily on the bodies of black women and men—bodies exploited through slavery and segregation, and, today, threatened, locked up, and murdered out of all proportion. What is it like to inhabit a black body and find a way to live within it? And how can we all honestly reckon with this fraught history and free ourselves from its burden?<br />  <br /><i>Between the World and Me </i>is Ta-Nehisi Coates’s attempt to answer these questions in a letter to his adolescent son. Coates shares with his son—and readers—the story of his awakening to the truth about his place in the world through a series of revelatory experiences, from Howard University to Civil War battlefields, from the South Side of Chicago to Paris, from his childhood home to the living rooms of mothers whose children’s lives were taken as American plunder. Beautifully woven from personal narrative, reimagined history, and fresh, emotionally charged reportage, <i>Between the World and Me </i>clearly illuminates the past, bracingly confronts our present, and offers a transcendent vision for a way forward."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""1214964"",""name"":""Ta-Nehisi Coates"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1595285597p5/1214964.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1595285597p2/1214964.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1214964.Ta_Nehisi_Coates"",""average_rating"":""4.26"",""ratings_count"":""396629"",""text_reviews_count"":""40936""}},""published"":""2015"",""work"":{""id"":""44848425"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.F-n-hb4HqoKqonNt8NpNkg""}}",4,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""412513505"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Wed Dec 30 10:57:56 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 30 10:57:56 -0800 2020,1,"

Notes about successes and failures, joys and sorrows, things that made me marvel, and things that made me laugh out loud. How to be fair. How to have less stress. How to have fun. How to hurt people less. How to get hurt less. How to be a good man. How to have meaning in life. How to be more me.<br /> <br />Recently, I worked up the courage to sit down with those diaries. I found stories I experienced, lessons I learned and forgot, poems, prayers, prescriptions, beliefs about what matters, some great photographs, and a whole bunch of bumper stickers. I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If you know how, and when, to deal with life’s challenges—how to get relative with the inevitable—you can enjoy a state of success I call “catching greenlights.”<br /> <br />So I took a one-way ticket to the desert and wrote this book: an album, a record, a story of my life so far. This is fifty years of my sights and seens, felts and figured-outs, cools and shamefuls. Graces, truths, and beauties of brutality. Getting away withs, getting caughts, and getting wets while trying to dance between the raindrops.<br /> <br />Hopefully, it’s medicine that tastes good, a couple of aspirin instead of the infirmary, a spaceship to Mars without needing your pilot’s license, going to church without having to be born again, and laughing through the tears.<br /> <br />It’s a love letter. To life.<br /> <br />It’s also a guide to catching more greenlights—and to realizing that the yellows and reds eventually turn green too.<br /> <br />Good luck."",""authors"":{""author"":{""id"":""3636965"",""name"":""Matthew McConaughey"",""role"":"""",""image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1598977375p5/3636965.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""small_image_url"":{""_"":""\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1598977375p2/3636965.jpg\n"",""nophoto"":""false""},""link"":""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3636965.Matthew_McConaughey"",""average_rating"":""4.28"",""ratings_count"":""21335"",""text_reviews_count"":""3333""}},""published"":""2020"",""work"":{""id"":""78998213"",""uri"":""kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v3.8IRzJ--Wk32Lk5GO""}}",5,0,false,none,"{""shelf"":{""name"":""read"",""exclusive"":""true"",""id"":""412513505"",""review_shelf_id"":""""}}",,,,,Wed Dec 30 10:55:55 -0800 2020,Wed Dec 30 10:55:55 -0800 2020,1,"
