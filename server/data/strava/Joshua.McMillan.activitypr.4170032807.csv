Ran first  2k slow then went for 4:40 pace for the next 2k, my watch read them fine (4:39, 4:42) went for 2k slow then for the next 2k on pace again & they felt great & right around the 4:40 mark but my watch read them at 5:29 then 6:11 which was super frustrating. I was about 300m from home so just coasted in, then when I finished my run I didn’t click save right away so it just discarded it which also, incredibly frustrating to finish it off. Still gonna go for that 10k on Saturday but knowing that my watch could mess up completely at seemingly any random point isn’t very sick.
